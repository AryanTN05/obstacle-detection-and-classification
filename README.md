## Obstacle Detection and Classification 

### Overview:

Welcome to the Obstacle Detection and Classification project! This repository is dedicated to the development of a machine learning-based system that leverages the power of YOLOv8, OpenCV, Deep SORT, and other cutting-edge technologies for real-time Obstacle detection and classification.

### Features:

*State-of-the-Art Obstacle Detection: We utilize YOLOv8 to provide robust and efficient obstacle detection capabilities, capable of identifying a wide range of obstacle.

*Accurate Obstacle Classification: Our project includes models and pipelines for classifying detected obstacle, providing insights into their types and categories.

*Real-Time Tracking: Deep SORT is integrated to enable real-time tracking of detected obstacle, making this system suitable for applications such as surveillance and autonomous vehicles.

*Extensible and Configurable: You can easily configure and extend the system to fit your specific use case and dataset.
