Object Detection and Classification 

Overview:

Welcome to the Object Detection and Classification project! This repository is dedicated to the development of a machine learning-based system that leverages the power of YOLOv8, OpenCV, Deep SORT, and other cutting-edge technologies for real-time object detection and classification.

Features:

*State-of-the-Art Object Detection: We utilize YOLOv8 to provide robust and efficient object detection capabilities, capable of identifying a wide range of objects.
*Accurate Object Classification: Our project includes models and pipelines for classifying detected objects, providing insights into their types and categories.
*Real-Time Tracking: Deep SORT is integrated to enable real-time tracking of detected objects, making this system suitable for applications such as surveillance and autonomous vehicles.
*Extensible and Configurable: You can easily configure and extend the system to fit your specific use case and dataset.
